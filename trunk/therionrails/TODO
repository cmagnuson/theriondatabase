-tag library to find points, segments, survey, etc. by tunnel system, then survey, then... AJAX or not?
-do test on all features - make a survey with an item tagged w/ each one
-database backup option
-transfer of prod db -> dev automatically for improved testing... if connection is possible

-move featureimport to auto on compile
-notes/original survey data for surveys
-loading of features from text/properties file
-add manual compile link
-google map of fixed point on FP page
-featureInstances belongsTo surveyStation and surveyConnection (can one of them still be null?) so deletes can be performed on surveys
-point features
-add equates - make work for multiple (2+) matched survey stations
-add fixed point output
-integration testing of therion export
-mysql db for prod
-quartz automated map generation
-download page
-integration testing
-clean up interface
-video import/viewing
-graphics of map for each survey
-way to display therion.log for error compiles, also show it or parse it for loop closure errors

Skipped:
-joins for all lines in each survey (thbook 29-30)
