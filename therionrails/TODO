TODO:
-sanity checking on import, print out errors
-legend for tunnelsystems and colors
-simple testing of views pages, just for exceptions
-tag library to find points, segments, survey, etc. by tunnel system, then survey, then... AJAX or not?
-do test on all features - make a survey with an item tagged w/ each one
-video class, tag surveys w/ 0+ of them, can add to other classes if wanted
-note line implementation, (for notes with features, also road name imp)
-fix label overlapping other features, maybe auto-offset label? or label w/ arrow?

Needed Features:
-height on interconnect (and coloring of higher system??)
-power lines - see DC email
-pipes - see DC email  -add both to last W survey


Resurvey:
-2nd check 18-19, see notes
-collect video for existing surveys
-water first survey - 3->5 missing, shot up to top of shaft in drift, see notes for 5 features

Done:
-embedding of svg into website more brower compliant... OR converting to jpg (either svg or pdf_
-fixed-point entry/update as lon/lat
-show fi's on survey connections
-data entry of original survey notes
-survey list use name in summary
-condense point/line into one bigger definition, let outputScrap decide based on sc/ss null	
-move featureimport to auto on compile
-notes/original survey data for surveys
-loading of features from text/properties file
-add manual compile link
-google map of fixed point on FP page
-featureInstances belongsTo surveyStation and surveyConnection (can one of them still be null?) so deletes can be performed on surveys
-point features
-add equates - make work for multiple (2+) matched survey stations
-add fixed point output
-integration testing of therion export
-mysql db for prod
-quartz automated map generation
-download page
-integration testing
-clean up interface
-video import/viewing
-graphics of map for each survey
-way to display therion.log for error compiles, also show it or parse it for loop closure errors
-legend fix on lines (straight)
-inside outside fixes on lines
-defaults for features
-sorting surveyStations/surveyConnections in survey view based on dateSurveyed
-added -backfilled sand -3/5/11/35	-2nd 4/5
-added -conc. wall - 44/31, and liner
-added -rock rubble
	-MN 41/43/44/46
-added note type (or associated with features) -notes for features (and their display on generated maps)
	-2nd 9/12 (2x4 to ceil, poured conc. above)
	-MN 39 - poured conc., crawlable, 105 - possible dig under
-make manual compile schedule a compile immediatly... - made it synchronized instead... not perfect solution but works
-make compile schedule a featureimport immediatly (or somehow block on it - make syncronized) - just made synchronized

Skipped:
-joins for all lines in each survey (thbook 29-30)
-video cutting to clips for each surveyConnection
-tagging of surveyConnections with start/end time for video purposes, option to import this from text file
-users and privledges - view vs. create/update vs. admin..?
-google map of KML on main page
-compare laptop/vs. server LRUD walls, fix if needed
-add area/generic line features...
-make fi code auto-include color code?
-database backup option
-transfer of prod db -> dev automatically for improved testing... if connection is possible
-minimized list of survey stations/connections in survey view (or maybe view of data as imported?)
-feature - -pipe under wall? - MN N 19
-FI - prompt to replace if adding a lining to sc with existing lining?
-detail levels - hide/show drifts on different maps


Resurvey Done:
MN  - 1-2 accurate distance
	- toolsts ledge to center - distance and angles
